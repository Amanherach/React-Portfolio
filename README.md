# React-Portfolio

Now that you've worked with React and have multiple projects to share, you'll be updating your portfolio and other materials to build toward being employer competitive. Creating a portfolio using React will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios do not use some of the latest technologies.

## Requirements

* Updated portfolio featuring 6 total projects

* Use React

* A `Header` component that appears on multiple pages

* A single `Project` component that will be used multiple times on a single page 

* Navigation with React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third part router

* A `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages

* Update GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring those same projects

## Follow React File Setup
I used a free template from Tim Baker and their components to create this more uniform contemporary portfolio page. I continued with the one portfolio page that scrolls with links to projects. 

1. Used initial react-resume-template
2. Created styling within the components and CSS folders.
3. Modified personal image and resume section and portfolio projects
4. Updated about and skill section
5. Updated reputation section
6. Updated contact section
7. Created new input form to allow others to contact me.
8. Created link to updated resume.
9. Updated footer to link to my current information
10. Overall styling follows the given react template with minor modifications to color of icons and images.

## Future Changes:
* add a functional email using email.js for the contact form
* add particle.js somewhere on the page for a visual fun effect.
